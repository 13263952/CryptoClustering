# CryptoClustering
Through Python and unsupervised learning, I am providing an example on my abilities to cluster information together in an attempt to have succesful predictions.

Find evidence of data being succesfully prepared, see how k was assigned the best value using the original scaled DataFrame. 

I clustered Cryptocurrencies from a Csv file with K-means, used Principal Component Analysis to optimize clusters.

The results are compared and contrasted to demonstrate difference in visualization using few features.
